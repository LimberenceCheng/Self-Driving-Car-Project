# Mask RCNN Object Detection

A quick intro to using the pre-trained model to detect and segment objects.A quick intro to using the pre-trained model to detect and segment objects.

## Configurations

We'll be using a model trained on the MS-COCO dataset. The configurations of this model are in the ```CocoConfig``` class in ```coco.py```.

For inferencing, modify the configurations a bit to fit the task. To do so, sub-class the ```CocoConfig``` class and override the attributes you need to change.
